photos
======

This is a lightweight web-based photo gallery. It only uses HTML/JavaScript/CSS technologies for the host part. The database and thumbnails are generated by a bash script.

How I use it
------------
I use this website on a raspberry pi directly LAN-connected to my ISP box. This box also contains an hard disk that can be used as a NAS. The "photos" directory is mapped to one directory of the hard disk via the samba protocol - the box does not provide NFS. It allows the solution to have enough available space for hosting photos - the raspberry pi use an 4GB SD card.

Package dependencies
--------------------
The following packages are needed to make the JSON database :

- imagemagick
- bc
- exiv2
- unaccent

Make the database
-----------------
In order to create the gallery index and each photo album index, we need to execute the "make.sh" script. This script is in the "library" directory.
If "database" or "photos" library subdirectories do not exist, they will be created by the script.
During the operation, the "index.html" page is substitued by the "make.html" which show a waiting message.
